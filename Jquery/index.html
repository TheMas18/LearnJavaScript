      Dookie is the third studio album by the American rock band Green Day,
      released on February 1, 1994, by Reprise Records. The band's major label
      debut, it was recorded in mid-1993 and is heavily based around frontman
      Billie Joe Armstrong's personal experiences, with themes such as boredom,
      anxiety, relationships, and sexuality. After several years of grunge's
      dominance in popular music, the album brought a livelier, more melodic
      rock sound to the mainstream. Considered one of the defining albums of the
      1990s and punk rock in general, Dookie was also pivotal in solidifying the
      genre's mainstream popularity. The album influenced a new wave of pop-punk
      bands, such as Blink-182, Sum 41, and Fall Out Boy. Though the band was
      labeled a sell-out by some of the band's original fans, the record
      received critical acclaim upon its release and won a Grammy Award for Best
      Alternative Music Album in 1995. (Full article...)
